# Bottle Detector for Web #

This project was done under request of a client, to allow a quick recognition of bottles from a pre-determined mark

In this project I used a set of pattern and image recognition algorithms to allow a precise and quick match

### What you will found here ###

* The logic used to match the images
* The algorithms used in the process (not all implemented by me, although i did some changes on them) 
* The views - simple and efective text to text or json to json inputs and outputs
* Some of parallel processing, used to optimize batch comparisons in json to json match
